2. RELATIVE  --  it means jaise mein karti hoon ssari cheexe ek folder meinhi rakho for ease
../cdbgn/vdb -- this enables us ".." to move out of that folder and look for the bigger root folder and then choose something.  ANOTHER ONE ./xjdb/vgmh  --  this "./" enables us to use any object present in that directory of folder -->

   <!--  CSS - Cascading Style Sheets 
   It allows us to style our websites make it more attractive.
   Their are many style sheet language such as CSS, Sass , Less and so on . But the most important one is  CSS
   Their are three types of css 1. Inline  2.Internal  3.External 
   1.INLINE - <tag style="css" /> - it can be added to any tag , break, hr, img, etc. here, ... 
   It is a type to add CSS  in to a particular HTML Tag 
   2. INTERNAL  - <style> css </style>  -- in between the  the opening and closing tag of style we use css . We can apply it anywhere inside the whole html document . To do css for a particular part we need to  use 'selector' 
   eg. - html{  background: red;  }
   3. EXTERNAL - <link href = "style.css" />  -- It is written in a completely different file having '.css' extension. So , to link our css fie with html file , in html file under head we use link tag and write the rel = stylesheet then href = "./  css file "
   
   But, inline css is good for single element, then internal css is good for one page website but -- for multi-page website external css is always prefered
