Document Object Model - DOM 
how to use JS in your website 
So lets create a separarte folder named DOM inside it create index.html
just like internal , external and inline css Js is also used 

INLINE JS TAGS 
1. onload - jab website load hoga toh qoutes ka cheex execute hoga 
onload"alert("Hello")"  here the browser thinks that alert( and ) are two different strings instead of the command hello . And thats why we use single and double qoutes so hello should be in single qoutes 

BUT ININE CSS HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS . IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEBUGG IT AND IS ALOS NOT GOOD PRACTICE 

INTERNAL JS 
alert("Hello"); just like that in the script tag in the BODY 
the website reads the js line by line and executes it 

document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML = "Good Bye"; this is in external file and js is at the bottom of the code so phele hello tha usko baad mein Good bye kar denge .
now if css ke baad head mein hi meine js bhi call kar liya toh h1 dhundhega woh jo exist hi nahi karta so it will throw error 
Therefore always js is written below or before the colsing tags ( before end of head) 

DOM ACTUALLY REFERS TO THE FORMATION OF TREE STRUCTURE BASED ON THE PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (CODE) . BASICALLY IT ACTS LIKE A ER DIAGRAM JAHAN PE TAGS KO AS ENTITIES TREAT KARTE HAI THEN USKE ANDAR KI INFO IS ITS VALUES . IT ALSO SHOWS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM. 
so suppose we have a dom - document
