very awesome explanation for datatypes , variables and basics of any programming language


The language that powers the website
Brendan Eich created Javascript in just 10 days 
PLAY - go to settings of chrome then find content settings there choose don't allow Javascriptfor sites 
Whatsapp , instagram , youtube and netflix and many more such websites don't even load when the Javascript is disabled  
Javascript was initally known as Livescript then Jscript  then ecmascript 
difference between java and javascript js is an interpreted programming language while java is compiled programming language python js ruby are interpreted languages whereas swift, c ,c++, and java are compiled languages
See MDN docs for the commands in js

Datatypes
everything inside the "__" is interpreted as string or message and numbers are in brackets but without "__" qoutes , Boolean - true and false

JS COMMANDS
alert("hello");     // prints the msg hello when i click enter
typeof(23);        // gives the datatype of the numbr or anything inside the ()
prompt()
var name_of_variable = "__"

String Concatenation 
"a" + "--" + "b"     or    "a" + name + "b"
String Lengths  -   var_name.length

To make a tweet length like tweeter but it still misses the not accepting condition when the characters exceed 140 characters 
var tweet = prompt("Enter you tweet...");
var length = tweet.length;
alert("Your tweet is of " + length + " characters. Now, you have only " + (140 - length) + "characters left");

Slicing and extracting the strings . So lets work with the tweeter wala thing to make sure it only tkes upto 140 characters 
var name = "Angela";
name.slice(0,1);   // output : A   why only a
java scropt has indexes from 0 and in the slice syntax it states that we want the string from the 1st number to n-1 th number of mentioned number. AS a result (0,1) gives only A as it is in 0th postion and excludes "n" form slicing.

var nammmee = "RiyaSanjayChaurasiya";
nammmee.length
20
nammmee.slice(4,22)
'SanjayChaurasiya'

Tweeter wala worked in a kind alert("Your tweet has " + tweet.length + " characters. \n Your tweet is " + tweet.slice(0,141) + " Do the necessary changes ");

Lower case Uppercase
nammmee.toUpperCase();
'RIYASANJAYCHAURASIYA'
nammmee.toLowerCase();
'riyasanjaychaurasiya'

make sure the system always says hey, User such that the first letter is always capital followed by the other in small  
var the_name = prompt("Enter your name: ");
var firstletter = the_name.slice(0,1);
var later = the_name.slice(1,100);
alert("Hey, " + firstletter.toUpperCase() + later.toLowerCase());

so on this my input was riya and it return me : "Hey Riya"    awesome right !!!

Basic arithmetic like addition , subtraction, multiplication , division and modulo where it gives you the remainder of the division of 1st number by the 2nd number. It can perform any arthimetic operations and expression with ease OBEYING THE "BODMAS" RULE 

dog age to human age converter 
human_age = (dog_age - 2) *4 +21;     // got NaN error what is it ??????

The inncrement decrement operators and all the assignment opertors like += , -=, *=, /=, %= are used efficiently by JS 

**************   FUNCTIONS   *************
Functions are a set of codes that are used repeatatively and it reduces the number of lines of code and can be called again and again without writing all those lines again 
So funtions are similar to the variables where value of variable is stroed under the name of vaiable similarly the bunch of codes is saved in under the name of the function 
function getmilk() {
    alert("Go left");
    alert("Go left");
    alert("Go up");
    alert("Go up");
}
getmilk();


console.log gives the string in the console 

video no. 92 
function getMilk() {   
  console.log("leaveHouse");
  console.log("moveRight");
  console.log("moveRight");
  console.log("moveUp");
  console.log("moveUp");
  console.log("moveUp");
  console.log("moveUp");
  console.log("moveRight");
  console.log("moveRight");
  console.log("moveLeft");
  console.log("moveLeft");
  console.log("moveDown");
  console.log("moveDown");
  console.log("moveDown");
  console.log("moveDown");
  console.log("moveLeft");
  console.log("moveLeft");
  console.log("enterHouse");
}

passing arguments : function getmilk(bottles) {}
then call it like getmilk(2)


RANDOMIZATION AND CONTROL FLOW 
Love Calculator

var n = Math.random()
n = n*100
n = Math.floor(n)
console.log(n);

prompt("What is your name ?")
prompt("What is their name?")
var lovescore = Math.random() * 100
lovescore = Math.floor(lovescore) + 1
alert("Your loverscore is : " + lovescore);

ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 
 == , != , >= , <= , >, < 
LOGICAL OPERATORS
&& , || , !

JAVASCRIPT ARRAYS 
var eggs = [2, 4, 5, 6, 23]
var egg1 = eggs[1]
var guestlist = ["Riya", "Chhaya" , "Sakshi" , "Stuti", "Rohit" , "Sana" , "Shravani", "Saurabh", "Didi", "Selva" , "Kapil"];
output : (11)Â ['Riya', 'Chhaya', 'Sakshi', 'Stuti', 'Rohit', 'Sana', 'Shravani', 'Saurabh', 'Didi', 'Selva', 'Kapil']
guestlist.includes("Simmi")
false
guestlist.includes("Stuti")
true

var guestname = prompt("What is your name?")
if (guestlist.includes(guestname))
{
    alert("Welcome!!!")}
else
{
    alert("We are sorry, you are not invited") ;}


var i = 1;
for (let i = 1; i <=21; i++) {
  // 100 tak jane mein systen hang kar raa hai and 3 and 5 wali combined loop run nahi ho raha hai. Becuse of the positioning of the codes it should have been placed first to execute first. 3 wala phele aa raha tha toh it checks that condition and gives the output   
    if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0)
    {
        alert("FizzBuzz");}
    else if (i % 5 == 0) {
        alert("Buzz");
    }
    else if (i % 3 == 0)
    {
        alert("Fizz");}
    
    else{
alert(i);}
}
AND IT WORKED !!!!!!!!

var i = 1;
undefined
while (i<2) {
    console.log(i);
    i ++;
}
// so yeh loop jo hai 2 baar run hoga 1st time pura then 2nd time it will only check the condition which is false and will skip the loop and move on 

CONTROL STATEMENTS - FOR LOOP
for(var = i ; i < 2; i++)
{
    console.log(i);
}

fibonacci sequence
function fibonacciGenerator (n) {
//Do NOT change any of the code above ðŸ‘†
    
    //Write your code here:
    var n1 = 0;
    var n2 = 1;
    console.log(n1);
    console.log(n2);
    for (var i = 0; i <n ; i++){
         var n3 = n1 + n2;
         console.log(n3);
         n1 = n2;
         n3 = n2;
    }

    //Return an array of fibonacci numbers starting from 0.
    
//Do NOT change any of the code below ðŸ‘‡
}
